        <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
            <p class="description">These vegetarian mushroom burgers are as close as it gets to delicious meat burgers. Mushrooms really
            give them a meaty flavour.</p>
        <h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
                <li>3(8 ounce) packages sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
                <li>1/2 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>3/4 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
                <li>2/3 cup rolled oats</li>
                <li>1/2 cup freshly shredded parmigiano-reggiano cheese</li>
                <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            </ul>
        <h2 class="directions">Directions</h2>
            <ol class="directions">
                <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, onion, garlic, salt,
                pepper, and oregano; cook and stir until mushrooms have released their juices and the liquid has
                evaporated, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
                <li>Transfer mushrooms to a cutting board and clean the skillet.</li>
                <li>Chop mushrooms into small chunks, then transfer to a large bowl. Mix in bread crumbs and oats, and
                season with salt and pepper as needed. Stir in Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, then eggs; let stand until
                bread crumbs have absorbed any excess liquid, about 15 minutes. Use moist hands to form mixture, 1/4
                cup at a time, into patties.</li>
                <li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry patties in the hot skillet
                until golden brown and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side.</li>
            </ol>
