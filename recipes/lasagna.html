        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>
                <li>1/2 pound lean ground beef</li>
                <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
                <li>1(18 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
                <li>1(8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
                <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>1/8 teaspoon white sugar</li>
                <li>1(16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
                <li>1 pound small-curd cottage cheese</li>
                <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1(16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until
                    browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. </li>
                <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano,
                    and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. </li>
                <li> While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
                    noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10
                    minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
                <li>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper
                    in a large bowl until combined. </li>
                <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to
                    coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture,
                    1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the
                    remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden
                    brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
            </ol>
